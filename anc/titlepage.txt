\begin{abstract}

\noindent
These lecture notes contain of a set of Interactive Python (Google
Colab) notebooks that were the basis for a one-week ML course at the
Albert Einstein Institute in Potsdam, taught by the author in June
2022. They give a hands-on introduction to not only Machine Learning
Fundamentals and underlying concepts and ideas (in some places
presented in a form that aligns with concepts known to theoretical
physicists that many machine learning practitioners would not be
familiar with), but also explain bottom-up some of the design goals of
modern machine learning frameworks, and how these can be harnessed to
solve a broad range of numerical problems that readily arise in
theoretical physics - even when not employing any "learning" per
se. This point is illustrated with examples such as a basic general
relativity ray tracer implemented on top of Google's TensorFlow. The
notebooks have been typeset with some minor expansions, fixes, and
modernizations. It is expected that they might be useful both for
self-study and also as a source of material for educators who want to
design similar courses.
