# IMPRS2022_ML

Material I covered on the IMPRS 2022 course held virtually at the Albert Einstein Institute:
"An Introduction to Machine Learning and ML tool basics for Physicists"
(Also see [the institute's web page on IMPRS courses](https://www.imprs-gcq.aei.mpg.de/19897/past-lecture-days).)


This was a 4-day compact course that started with a skeletal introduction to Python,
covered Machine Learning basics, and towards the end demonstrated some unconventional
applications of the technology that was built for ML, culminating in a simplistic
curved-spacetime ray tracer for black holes.
